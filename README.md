# Autonomous-system-for-collecting-floating-waste
### Abstract
This project centers on an autonomous robotic system designed to tackle the prevalent
issue of floating waste in water bodies. This innovative solution, equipped with ad-
vanced computer vision, swiftly detects and collects floating debris upon identification,
addressing the pressing environmental threat posed by these pollutants. The robotâ€™s
adaptable design ensures efficient navigation through diverse water conditions, while
a manual control option adds flexibility, allowing human intervention as needed. By
harnessing cutting-edge technology this system heralds a promising approach to combat
pollution, safeguard aquatic ecosystems, and pave the way for a cleaner, healthier
planet.
